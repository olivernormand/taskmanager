# taskmanager

## How to run the project

1. Install the dependencies. I've used `uv` for the package management. Activate the environment.
2. Create the `.env` with your own environment variables. You can use the `.env.example` as a template.
3. Start the server from the root directory by running `python taskmanager/src/taskmanager/main.py`
4. Start the taskmanager agent in a seperate terminal by `python main.py`, then chat away.
